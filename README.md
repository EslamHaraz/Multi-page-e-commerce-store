# Multi-page-e-commerce-store
This store includes customers, employees, and merchants. Additionally, the website incorporates a CRUD system.
through this system, you can perform modifications, additions, or deletions to any product.
Additionally, the website supports two languages, Arabic and English. It also includes two themes, Dark Mode and Light Mode.
I have used the following technologies: Vue.js - HTML5 - CSS3 - Vuex - Vuelidate for validations - Json Server.
